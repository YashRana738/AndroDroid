MountDroid is a powerful shell script designed for rooted Android devices that allows you to host ISO files stored on your android devices and make them bootable on a PC removing the need for USB drive. It turns your phone into a virtual ISO host, emulating the behavior of a bootable USB using GadgetFS.
